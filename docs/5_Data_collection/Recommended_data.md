# Recommended minimum data and metadata variables for calculating genetic diversity indicators

This section outlines the minimum data needed to calculate the genetic diversity indicators for a particular species within a country (Table 1), as well as additional metadata variables that are optional though can be useful for reproducibility, traceability and analyses (Table 2). 

Data for each variable can be recorded using any tool (e.g. Excel, scripts for extracting data from existing databases), but you can also use the user-friendly Kobotoolbox described above. Thus for each variable, we also provide the name of that variable in the Kobo form, for anyone not using the Kobo form. Using this name for the variables is also needed for the R processing scripts to run accordingly, thus, we suggest using the following variable names if the provided scripts would be used. 

{: .note }
Although the taxonomic information of the species is necessary to gather data and perform the assessment of the genetic diversity indicators, for public reports it is possible to obscure the taxonomic information in cases where making this information public could harm the species conservation. In fact, none of the information collected is required to be made public.

NcRange values can be converted into a single number using the following guidelines:  If NcRange is 'more than 5000 by much', Nc_from_range = 10000; 'more than 5000' = 5500; 'range includes 5000 = 5001; 'less than 5000' = 4050;  'less than 5000 by much' = 500 | Integer | 5500 | Nc_from_range |

\* Needed to perform summary analyses or aggregate results by desired categories.

^ The GBIF taxon ID is useful because it links the taxonomic identification of the species to other information, and to track taxonomic changes. The common names of the species are useful for communication and community participation. 

{: .note }
Other useful metadata include the realm (terrestrial, aquatic, marine), and ecosystem (e.g. rainforest), as well as threat status. These are not required, but they are useful to disaggregate the indicators.
